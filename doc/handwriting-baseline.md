# Handwriting recognition: first local baseline

2026-09-27, wkelly's completed five-page sampler. **Promising word recovery,
insufficient literal transcription.** Microsoft TrOCR Base improves on Small,
but its modest accuracy gain costs substantially more host CPU time and memory.

## What ran

- 20 ink-only images from production journal replay, including the erased and
  rewritten final line. Printed template text and rules are absent.
- Labels visually reviewed before inference; the operator confirmed the two
  ambiguous readings. Source journals, images and labels remain private under
  `pinenote/tools/handwriting/build/collection-20260927/`.
- Microsoft `trocr-small-handwritten` at
  `b4648cfa171985a6745f37ddd637e98c0da958ac` and `trocr-base-handwritten` at
  `eaacaf452b06415df8f10bb6fad3a4c11e609406`, pretrained and IAM-fine-tuned
  upstream. No local training or sample-dependent model/preprocessing tuning.
- Full 1404×240 line bands, RGB conversion, stock model processor
  (`use_fast=False`); greedy decoding, maximum 128 new tokens, no prompt or
  spelling correction. Neither model hit the token limit. All predictions were
  saved before the evaluation program opened labels.
- Ryzen 9 9950X3D workstation, eight CPU threads, float32, Python 3.11.14,
  PyTorch 2.8.0+cpu, Transformers 4.56.2. Models ran sequentially in separate
  processes. One blank-image warm-up each. Per-line wall time includes image
  loading, preprocessing, generation and decoding; excludes download, model
  loading and warm-up. One pass, not a latency distribution study.

The loader warns about newly initialized `encoder.pooler.dense` weights. Source
inspection of Transformers 4.56.2's `VisionEncoderDecoderModel.forward` shows
that the decoder receives `encoder_outputs[0]` (sequence hidden states), not
the pooler output. These unused pooler parameters do not imply an untrained
recognition decoder. The original warnings are retained in the local logs.

## Results

Rates are corpus-weighted Levenshtein edits divided by reference length, not
mean per-line rates. Raw CER includes spaces, case and punctuation; raw WER
splits only on whitespace. There are 710 reference characters and 133 raw words.

| Measure | TrOCR Small | TrOCR Base |
|---|---:|---:|
| Parameters, loaded | 61,596,672 | 333,921,792 |
| Raw character error rate | 11.69% (83/710) | 9.72% (69/710) |
| Raw word error rate | 57.14% (76/133) | 54.14% (72/133) |
| Secondary lexical word error rate | 14.71% | 11.03% |
| Exact lines, raw | 0/20 | 0/20 |
| Exact lines, lexical | 8/20 | 10/20 |
| Median line wall time | 0.122 s | 0.847 s |
| Peak process RSS | 651.8 MiB | 2537.5 MiB |
| Shared 19-line raw CER | 12.05% | 9.97% |

The secondary lexical measure casefolds and extracts word/number tokens with
internal apostrophes retained. Decimal points and colons separate numeric
tokens. It is a word-content diagnostic and intentionally does not measure
punctuation fidelity. Both models produce spaces before punctuation, inflating
raw WER and preventing exact matches even when words are correct. Keep both
views; the secondary measure is not a replacement accuracy headline.

RSS is the Linux process high-water mark including Python, PyTorch, model load
and warm-up, not just weights or an isolated steady-state working set. These
are desktop measurements, not ARM latency or memory qualification.

### What the errors mean

- Ordinary prose is often recognizable; Base recovers more words correctly.
- Numerals, currency and some word shapes remain substantial weaknesses.
- Both models add punctuation to a line written without terminal punctuation.
- Both silently normalize an operator-confirmed spelling slip. Recognition
  must therefore be derived, correctable text, never an overwrite of the ink.
- Raster replay handled the erasure normally. No discarded/hidden strokes were
  supplied to either recognizer. The final line remains excluded from the
  19-line trajectory comparison set.

This is one writer and 20 short prompted lines. It establishes a reproducible
feasibility baseline, not general accuracy, page segmentation performance or
reliability. Further choices made using these results require fresh handwriting
for independent confirmation. Keep Small as the inexpensive baseline; compare
another recognition family and preprocessing on an explicit development set
before spending a hardware session on deployment.

- **[TrOCR](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/trocr-transformer-based-optical-character-recognition-with-pre-trained-models/)**
  (AAAI 2023): the directly actionable Microsoft result for these cropped
  handwritten lines. [Official code and model table](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/trocr)
  list Small/Base/Large as 62M/334M/558M parameters and IAM CERs of
  4.22/3.42/2.89%. Those published dataset scores are not our results.
  [Small weights](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/trocr-small-handwritten) and
  [Base weights](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten) are
  the releases used here.
- **[Project Ink Analysis](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ink-analysis/)**:
  relevant system design for stroke-based recognition, layout and shapes.
  Its project page advertises handwriting in 67 languages. The material
  inspected did not establish a downloadable Linux-compatible pretrained
  trajectory recognizer; no such engine was run in this baseline.
- **[Florence-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-base)**:
  released Microsoft vision models with OCR tasks; Base is 0.23B parameters.
  Worth a later comparison, but the general vision/OCR model card is not proof
  of performance on this handwriting. Not run here.
- **[InkFM](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.23081v1)** (2025) is **Google DeepMind**,
  not Microsoft. It studies full-page online ink segmentation, recognition
  and classification. Relevant trajectory/page-understanding research, but
  the reviewed paper did not establish an immediately usable released model
  for this host comparison. The planned trajectory baseline remains open.
